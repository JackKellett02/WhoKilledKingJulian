  - After finishing dinner with my father, I went back to my room to write a letter
    to my love and then went to bed.
  - I didn't see anyone as I was in my room.
  - My father and I had a bit of a rocky relationship at times, but doesnt any father
    and son.
  - The chef probably has an issue with my father as hes always complaining about
    the food.

  - If i had to say anyone, Id guess it was the chef.
