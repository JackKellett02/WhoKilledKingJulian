  m_suspectInterviewText:
  - I was in my chambers practising my act for the fair tomorrow.
  - I saw the prince and king at dinner. I then later saw the guard taking a drink
    to the king when i went to the bathroom.
  - The king is great, its an honour to be his court jester
  - The guard and the prince. The prince often is arguing with how the king runs
    the land and the guard seems to be sick of fighting in the kings wars.
  - The prince and the guard both have access.
  - It was either the guard or the prince, im not sure who would do it though.
