  m_suspectInterviewText:
  - After dinner I was cleaning up in the kitchen and made a drink for the king and
    then went to bed.
  - I saw the guard when i handed him the drink for the king
  - He was a pompous ass who complained about everything i made.
  - The guard was talking to me the other day about how hes sick and tired of the
    king declaring so many wars and refuses to fight another one for him.
  - The guard would have had access as he often is stationed protecting the princes
    room.
  - Well the guard seems to be the obvious choice right?
